#### Key Takeaways
At the end of the study, the group A.K.A - R observed the following takeaways;

- We calculated and infered the average problem index (indicator crated by the group) of each announcement type/event.
- We observed the five accomplished projects in the last three years, with the highest problem index (indicator created by the group) and affected locations. S.Yolu Z.Burnu-Bakırköy had the highest problem index. This project took approximately six months.
- We investigated the relationship between municipality election and the number of running projects/constructions and so forth.
- We checked the effect of the pandemic on the accident notifications and seen that there was a strong effect of the pandemic due to the lockdowns between March and April in 2020. 
- We showed the distribution of announcement types during holiday terms and commented on the reasons behind these announcements.
